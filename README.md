# SCVE

Super Cool Video Editor

Written in C#.

Inspired by [Hazel](https://github.com/TheCherno/Hazel).

Based on:

- [Silk.NET](https://github.com/dotnet/Silk.NET)
- [ImageSharp](https://github.com/SixLabors/ImageSharp/)
- likely many more.

## Solution structure

- SCVE.Core contains all core abstractions, needed for the app (not in use currently).

## Current state

For now the app will display Project Panel and Sequence Panel.

## TODO

## Possible backends
